3. **Internal and External Inquiries**:
   - Handles inquiries related to internal HR policies and external general questions.
   - Provides accurate and relevant information by querying internal and external databases using a vector store retriever.
   - The system can dynamically adapt to user queries, offering precise and context-aware responses.

4. **Interactive and Conversational**:
